# Welcome!

Hey there! Welcome to my blog. I'm Malte Hedderich, and I'm a machine learning engineer.

I'm passionate about coding, artificial intelligence, and MLOps, I hold a Master of Science degree in Business Informatics from the Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany, and have studied Software Engineering at Tongji University in Shanghai, China.

Living by the motto, "If you're not moving forward, you're moving backward," I am always ready to embrace new challenges and look forward to bringing my expertise in AI and machine learning to new and exciting projects.
